# N-Body Dynamics Simulator
 
SIMULATES THE DYNAMICS OF N MASSIVE BODIES UNDER THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE
MASSES ARE SIMULATED AS POINT MASSES AND PROPEGATED FORWARD IN TIME VIA
KICK-DRIFT-KICK DISCRETE TIME PROPEGATION (SEE n_body.simulate() BELOW)

# USAGE DOCUMENTATION


this example generates the movie file listed in the repository under "n_body_trials/*"
using:
G = 1
view_lim = 5
save = 100
run_time = 100

set initial conditions

>init_conds = np.array([
	[100,0,0,0,0,0,0],
	[1,0,-3,0,3,4,0],
	[1,0,3,0,-3,-4,0],
	[1,-3,0,0,0,-4,0],
	[1,3,0,0,0,4,0]
	])

set experiment runtime
>run_time = 10 [seconds]

initialize simulation class

>sim = n_body(init_conds,run_time)

run simulation

>sim.simulate()

plot the results

sets framerate for saved simulation - set to 0 to playback only

>save = 100

automatically adjusts view to keep all masses in view

>autoscroll = False 

better to just generate the video and watch it at full speed

>replay = False

scales view to [-view_lim, view_lim]

>view_lim = 20

>sim.plot(save,autoscroll,replay,view_lim)

saved simulations take up ~2-20 MB depedning on run_time
generating the simulated video will take ~1-15 minutes 
depending on the length of simulation and your hardware

# WAIT UNTIL THE CODE FINISHES RUNNING COMPLETLY BEFORE TRYING TO OPEN THE VIDEO FILE

OTHER HELPFUL USAGE TIPS

if you don'y care about selecting parameters, 
the entire simulation can be run inline as

>n = 3

>sim = n_body(3).run()

or 
	
randomly generates 2-5 masses

>sim = n_body().run()  

The parameters you should focus on changing are:

- initial_conds - be creative with your initial conditions!
	
- self.G - strength of gravity
	
- self.S - damping on collisions

- run_time - simulation length

- scale - scales maximum radius of uniform random distribution for random poisition generation

- save - frames per second of simulation output video

- view_lim - axes ranges for visualization

DEV NOTES:

- visualizations are mapped from X-Y-Z space to the X-Y plane for visualization

- visualizations are shown in the Center-of-Mass (COM) frame

- everything *should* work but I wrote this in three days so pls don't roast me on Twitter for my hacky code thx <3

- lmk if something is broken though, thx!!!

- have fun :)
